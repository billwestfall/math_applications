# Randify

##### Randify is a command line tool to play random songs from Spotify based on a dictionary search. 
##### For the core of Randify I want to use the work already done in shpotify by Harish Narayanan: https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify
in the final incarnation when you start Randify it will continue playing randomly chosen songs until you stop the script.
some possible enhancements could be creating a playlist from a number of returned songs so the list can be saved on a mobile device to play offline
