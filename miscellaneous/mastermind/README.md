Mastermind implementation from Rosetta Code , see http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Mastermind#Python
 
 001 version is original from Rosetta Code , made working by removing eval
 
 002 is version with six MasterMind colors (White, Black, Blue, Red, Green) and 4 slots max . like on a MasterMind board
 
 003 is version rules from  game itself, i.e. don't disclose position of correct color , in either correct or wrong position. To implement I'll just randomize the order of output of 002 above
